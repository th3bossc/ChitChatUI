        A GPT bot made by fine-tuning and training microsoft's dialoGPT-medium model on human conversations

        It can casually converse with near human-like responses and has short-term memory to give a feel that you're conversing with an actual person.
        Do note that the responses need not be factually accurate most of the time.
    </p-panel>
    <p-panel header="What it's made of">
        Under the hood, the model is running a GPT-2 architecture, which is a decoder-only model based on transformers. The model has been fine-tuned using various training datasets from kaggle and reddit threads that makes it profficient in holding up causal conversations and long chains of continous to and fro chatting.

        a T5 bot made by fine-tuning google's T5 architecture

        It is slightly worse at providing human-like chat responses but it has been pre-trained by google on around 500 different datasets and around 2000 different tasks including translation, summarization, question answering, reasoning, multiple choice question answering and various other cases.
        Do note, due to the severe complexity of such a multi-task model and the low hardware capability, a slightly smaller version of the model is used and hence the responses may not be as perfect as it should be.
        The model does a really good job at concise queries.
